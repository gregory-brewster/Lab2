First, the variable mymap is created with it centered on downtown Calgary. Then the map is visually by 
adding the layer to the website. This is done my accessing the Mapbox API using a provided access token. 
Next is when the user inputs the date ranges. Once the dates have been entered, the function myFunction 
is entered. First, the building permits within the inputted date ranges are gathered from Calgaryâ€™s API 
and added as markers on the map.
